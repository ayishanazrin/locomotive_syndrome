**Locomotive Syndrome Prediction**

This data analytics project focuses on predicting locomotive syndrome in older adults using a Decision Tree model. Locomotive syndrome, marked by mobility and functional decline, poses health risks for seniors. The GLFS25 Predictor class loads, preprocesses data, and trains a Decision Tree model. Key features include Age, Single Leg Standing Time, Grip Strength, TUG Result, and the target variable GLFS25. The model enables users to input characteristics for predicting locomotive syndrome likelihood. The insights gained could inform early detection and intervention strategies for improved geriatric care. Future refinements may enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
